Make sure to run the server code in one terminal first. Copy the key it generates, which is printed to you in the terminal. 
Next, open the chatApplication file, and edit the value of "key" to have the value which you copied from the server code
While server is still running, run the chatApplication code in a separate terminal. You should see a new window pop up where you can type.
To simulate two users communicating, run the chatApplication code in a third terminal window. You can also type in that separate window
To see the communication occuring live, have the server terminal window open
